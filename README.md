# FUTURE_ML_02 – Customer Churn Prediction System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of **Machine Learning Task 2** by **Future Interns**.  
The goal is to build a **Customer Churn Prediction System** that identifies customers who are likely to stop using a service.  

The project uses **Logistic Regression** to predict churn probability and presents insights through an **interactive Power BI dashboard** for business decision-making.

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Customer churn is a major concern in industries such as telecom, banking, and SaaS.  
Retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

This project helps businesses:
- Predict customer churn probability
- Identify key factors driving churn
- Take proactive retention actions

## 🗂 Dataset
- **Dataset Name:** Telco Customer Churn Dataset  
- **Source:** Kaggle  
- **Records:** 7,000+ customers  
- **Target Variable:** `Churn`

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data preprocessing
- **Scikit-learn** – Logistic Regression model
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – Feature importance & evaluation
- **Power BI** – Dashboard visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook**

---

## ⚙️ Project Workflow
1. Data loading and exploration  
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
3. Encoding categorical variables  
4. Train-test split  
5. Model training using Logistic Regression  
6. Model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix)  
7. Churn probability prediction  
8. Dashboard creation in Power BI  

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Customers with **month-to-month or short-term contracts** have higher churn risk
- **Fiber optic internet users** show higher churn probability
- **Electronic check payment method** is strongly associated with churn
- Lack of **online security services** increases churn likelihood

---

## 📈 Dashboard Highlights
The Power BI dashboard includes:
- Overall churn rate
- Average churn probability
- Key churn drivers (contract type, internet service, payment method)
- Business-friendly visual insights
